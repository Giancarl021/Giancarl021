## About me

I am a Brazilian developer with backend services, mostly APIs, tools, and websites. Most of my open-source/hobby work follows the **`start` &rarr; `end`** (waterfall) approach, where I start a project with a clear end in sight, and I try to make it as simple as possible. Still, in corporate environments, I use Agile Methodologies, such as Agile and Scrum.

Most of my work experience is with the [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) cloud provider, with a bit of [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) seasoning.

One of my core goals in development is to provide reliability and stability, such as long-lived services, rare crashes, if any, and a good and consistent Developer Experience (DX).

I also try my best to modularize and generlize my work, to avoid code repetition along projects.

## Education

My education started with local schools forming my primary education, afterwards, I studied my high school in the [IFSul](https://www.gravatai.ifsul.edu.br/), a federal institution with a certificate in Web Development alongside the default curriculum. Concluding my current education sits [IFRS](https://ifrs.edu.br/canoas/), another federal institution that gave me a graduation in System Analysis and Development.

- **Primary education and Middle School:** 2009-2016 at local schools
- **High School with a certificate in Web Development:** 2017-2021 at [IFSul](https://www.gravatai.ifsul.edu.br/)
- **College:** 2021-2024 at [IFRS](https://ifrs.edu.br/canoas/)

## Work Experience

I have more than 5 years of experience developing cloud-native backend solutions and supporting libraries, with most of my core hard skills being acquired from working at [Cloud2Go](https://cloud2go.com.br/). There I developed mostly for [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/), tackling challenges such as long-running data collectors, cost-efficient data storage and consumption, library development, and application life cycles.

- **Algorithms Monitor:** 2018-2018 at [IFSul](https://www.gravatai.ifsul.edu.br/)
- **Trainee in Backend Development:** 2019-2021 at [Cloud2Go](https://cloud2go.com.br/)
- **Backend Developer:** 2021-_current_ at [Cloud2Go](https://cloud2go.com.br/)

## Certifications

I have some [Microsoft Certifications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/), most being development-inclined:
